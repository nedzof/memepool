# AI Video Generation Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [x] Implement base video generation service interface
- [x] Create adapter for Stability AI's Stable Video Diffusion
- [x] Set up local model serving infrastructure
- [x] Implement distributed task queue system
- [x] Add monitoring/metrics integration

## Phase 2: Model Integration
- [x] Integrate Lightweight Model (e.g. AnimateDiff-Light)
- [x] Implement model versioning system
- [x] Add automatic model scaling
- [x] Create fallback mechanism for model failures

## Phase 3: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement GPU pooling
- [ ] Add smart batch processing
- [ ] Develop progressive rendering
- [ ] Create cache layer for frequent requests

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement real-time preview streaming
- [ ] Add style transfer capabilities
- [ ] Develop motion path editing
- [ ] Create template system for common effects

## Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring
- [ ] Set up auto-scaling cluster
- [ ] Implement usage tracking
- [ ] Add quality metrics collection
- [ ] Create A/B testing framework

## Migration Strategy
1. Start with API-based services (Stability AI)
2. Gradually introduce on-prem models
3. Phase out third-party dependencies
4. Implement hybrid mode for transition period
