### 1. Blockchain Integration

**1.1 Video Inscription on BSV Blockchain**
- **Objective**: Enable users to inscribe 5-second AI-generated meme videos onto the BSV blockchain.
- **Approach**:
  - **Video Optimization**: Compress and optimize video files to minimize data size before inscription.
  - **Smart Contract Implementation**: Use sCrypt smart contracts to handle the inscription process, storing the entire video and associated metadata (e.g., video hash, creator ID, timestamp) on-chain.
  - **Transaction Fee**: Implement a 2% fee for each inscription, automatically deducted via the smart contract.

**1.2 Tradable Video Assets**
- **Objective**: Allow videos to be traded as digital assets.
- **Approach**:
  - **Marketplace Smart Contract**: Develop a smart contract to manage video listings, bids, and sales.
  - **Revenue Distribution**: Automatically distribute 90% of the sale revenue to the current owner and 10% to the original creator.
  - **Ownership Handling**: Use blockchain to track and verify ownership changes, ensuring transparency and security.
  - **Platform Fee**: Deduct a 2% platform fee on each trade.

### 2. View Time Tracking and Payment Distribution

**2.1 View Time Tracking**
- **Objective**: Accurately track view times and charge users 1 sat per second.
- **Approach**:
  - **Hybrid Tracking System**: Implement a combination of client-side scripts and server-side logic to track viewtime in real-time.
  - **Client-Side Tracking**: Use JavaScript to monitor when a user starts and stops watching a video, sending data to the server in real-time.
  - **Server-Side Validation**: Validate and aggregate viewtime data on the server, periodically updating the blockchain with total viewtime for each video.
  - **Smart Contract Integration**: Use smart contracts to handle payment distribution based on validated viewtime data.

**2.2 Payment Distribution**
- **Objective**: Distribute payments efficiently to creators and the reward pool.
- **Approach**:
  - **Automated Distribution**: Use smart contracts to automate the distribution of viewtime payments: 45% to creators and 55% to the reward pool.
  - **Reward Cycle**: Implement a reward cycle based on BSV block time, distributing rewards to the top 3 watched memes and the top 100 fastest viewers.

### 3. User Experience Optimization

**3.1 Simplified Payment Process**
- **Objective**: Minimize the need for frequent wallet signatures.
- **Approach**:
  - **Session-based Authentication**: Implement a system where users sign a smart contract at the start of their session, allowing them to watch multiple videos without additional signature requests until a predefined time limit is reached.

**3.2 User Interface Design**
- **Objective**: Create an intuitive and engaging user interface.
- **Approach**:
  - **Responsive UI**: Design a UI that is easy to navigate, with clear calls to action for video watching and trading.
  - **Accessibility and Performance**: Ensure compliance with accessibility standards and optimize for high traffic.

### 4. Backend Solutions

**4.1 Technical Stack**
- **Languages**: TypeScript for frontend and backend logic, sCrypt for smart contracts.
- **Frameworks**: Use Node.js for server-side operations and React for frontend development.
- **APIs**: Integrate with BSV blockchain APIs for transaction monitoring and validation.

**4.2 Security and Performance**
- **Objective**: Ensure secure and efficient operations.
- **Approach**:
  - **Input Validation and Data Sanitization**: Prevent security vulnerabilities.
  - **Caching Strategies**: Optimize performance and reduce load times.
  - **Regular Updates and Audits**: Keep dependencies updated and conduct security audits.

### 5. Content Retrieval and Display

**5.1 Video Retrieval**
- **Objective**: Efficiently retrieve video content from the blockchain for display on the platform.
- **Approach**:
  - **Blockchain Querying**: Use BSV blockchain APIs to query and retrieve video data and metadata.
  - **Content Delivery**: Implement a content delivery network (CDN) to cache and serve video content efficiently.

**5.2 User Interaction**
- **Objective**: Enable seamless user interaction for watching and trading videos.
- **Approach**:
  - **Real-time Updates**: Use WebSockets or similar technologies to provide real-time updates on video availability and trading status.
  - **User Notifications**: Implement a notification system to alert users of new videos, bids, and sales.

### 6. Testing and Deployment

**6.1 Testing Strategy**
- **Objective**: Ensure reliability and functionality.
- **Approach**:
  - **Unit and Integration Tests**: Conduct tests for individual components, smart contracts, and backend processes.
  - **End-to-End Tests**: Implement tests for critical user flows.

**6.2 Deployment Pipeline**
- **Objective**: Streamline deployment and updates.
- **Approach**:
  - **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate testing and deployment.
  - **Environment-specific Configurations**: Implement configurations for development, testing, and production.
