Part 1: The Creative Process - From Meme to 3D Masterpiece

Initial Creation Phase

Memes start their journey here. Creators scan trending content across major platforms - Twitter, Reddit, TikTok, and 4chan. Smart creators keep tabs on multiple sources through Memepool's integrated trend dashboard. Platform algorithms track meme velocity across these networks, highlighting potential winners before they peak. Magic happens in the transformation suite. Creators drop their chosen meme into Memepool's AI engine. The system first analyzes the meme's key elements - subjects, backgrounds, text, and emotional context. Neural networks trained on millions of 3D models begin breaking down the 2D image into spatial components. Depth mapping kicks in, creating initial 3D scaffolding.

Part 2: The Economic Engine - How Money Moves in Memepool
Real-Time Revenue System

Money flows instantly here. Creators see earnings tick up with each viewer interaction. Bitcoin's Lightning Network handles microtransactions at scale, enabling instant settlements. Smart contracts automatically distribute rewards based on engagement metrics. Viewers spend "Meme Credits" (MC) which convert to sats in real-time.
Revenue Breakdown

Numbers matter. Here's how money moves:

    25% instant streaming payments
    75% competition pool distribution

    30% split among top 10
    25% distributed to ranks 11-100

Part 3: The Tech Stack - How This Beast Actually Runs
BSV Backbone

Memepool rides on Bitcoin SV, and here's why it's sick. Every meme transformation gets stamped on-chain, making ownership crystal clear. BSV's massive blocks mean we can stuff entire meme collections without breaking a sweat. Scrypt mining keeps everything secure and scalable. WhatsOnChain integration lets anyone verify their stuff instantly. Transaction fees stay microscopic even when we're pushing thousands of transforms per minute. Smart contracts handle all the money moves without the gas fee nightmares you see elsewhere.
AITubo.ai Integration

The secret sauce comes from AITubo.ai's neural nets. These bad boys can turn any 2D meme into 3D faster than you can say "wen moon". Custom-trained models understand meme culture - they know the difference between a Pepe and a Wojak. Real-time processing means no waiting around - you get instant previews while the final render cooks. The AI stack learns from every transformation, getting smarter with each block. Cross-platform compatibility means your memes look sick everywhere.

Part 5: Growth Mechanics - How This Thing Gets Huge
Viral By Design
Every transformation has the potential to pop off. BSV's cheap fees mean creators can spam their best work everywhere without burning cash. AITubo integration means quality stays high even when volume's insane. Cross-platform sharing's built into the DNA - one click sends your 3D meme to Twitter, TikTok, and Telegram. When something hits, it hits everywhere at once.
