# Tutorial 1: Hello World


## Overview
In this tutorial, we will cover how to create a "Hello World" smart contract, deploy it, and call it.

Before starting, ensure all [prerequisite tools](../../installation) are installed.

## Create a new project

Run the following commands to create a new project:

```sh
npx scrypt-cli project helloworld
cd helloworld
npm install
```

The resulting project will contain a sample smart contract `/src/contracts/helloworld.ts`, along with all the scaffolding.

For this example, let's modify it to the following code:


```ts
import { assert, ByteString, method, prop, sha256, Sha256, SmartContract } from 'scrypt-ts'

export class Helloworld extends SmartContract {

    @prop()
    hash: Sha256;

    constructor(hash: Sha256){
        super(...arguments);
        this.hash = hash;
    }

    @method()
    public unlock(message: ByteString) {
        assert(sha256(message) == this.hash, 'Hash does not match')
    }
}
```

This `Helloworld` contract stores the sha256 hash of a message in the contract property `hash`. Only a message which hashes to the value set in `this.hash` will unlock the contract.

Now letâ€™s look at what is in the smart contract.

- `SmartContract`: all smart contracts must extend the `SmartContract` base class.
- `@prop`:  the [`@prop` decorator](../how-to-write-a-contract/basics#properties) marks a contract property.
- `@method`: the [`@method` decorator](../how-to-write-a-contract/basics#method-decorator) marks a contract method. A [public method](../how-to-write-a-contract/basics#public-methods) is an entry point to a contract.
- `assert`: throws an error and makes the method call fail if its first argument is `false`. Here it ensures the passed message hashed to the expected digest.

## Compile Contract

1. Run following command to compile the `Helloworld` contract:

```sh
npx scrypt-cli compile
```

This command will generate a contract artifact file at `/artifacts/helloworld.json`.

2. Then call the `loadArtifact()` function in the code:


```ts
await Helloworld.loadArtifact()
```

## Compile using the `watch` option

Monitoring for Real-time Error Detection

```sh
npx scrypt-cli compile --watch
```

The `watch` option in the provided command continuously monitors errors during the sCrypt compilation process.
Watch mode enables users to observe real-time updates and notifications regarding any errors specific to sCrypt, which are distinct from TypeScript errors.

## Contract Deployment & Call

Before we deploy the contract, you need to generate a Bitcoin key.

```bash
npm run genprivkey
```

then follow the [faucet instructions](../../how-to-deploy-and-call-a-contract/faucet) to fund the key.

Next, start deploying and calling the contract:

1. To [deploy a smart contract](../how-to-deploy-and-call-a-contract/how-to-deploy-and-call-a-contract.md#contract-deployment), simply call its `deploy` method.
1. To [call a smart contract](../how-to-deploy-and-call-a-contract/how-to-deploy-and-call-a-contract.md#contract-call), call one of its public methods.

For this example, overwrite `deploy.ts` in the root of the project with the following code to deploy and call the `Helloworld` contract:

```ts
import { Helloworld } from './src/contracts/helloworld'
import { getDefaultSigner } from './tests/utils/txHelper'
import { toByteString, sha256 } from 'scrypt-ts'

(async () => {

    // set network env
    process.env.NETWORK = 'testnet'
    // alternatively, set `NETWORK=testnet` in the .env file

    const message = toByteString('hello world', true)

    await Helloworld.loadArtifact()
    const instance = new Helloworld(sha256(message))

    // connect to a signer
    await instance.connect(getDefaultSigner())

    // deploy the contract and lock up 42 satoshis in it
    const deployTx = await instance.deploy(42)
    console.log('Helloworld contract deployed: ', deployTx.id)

    // call the contract
    const { tx: callTx } = await instance.methods.unlock(message)
    console.log('Helloworld contract `unlock` called: ', callTx.id)
})()
```

Run the following command to deploy AND call our example contract.

```
npx ts-node deploy.ts
```

You will see some output like:

Congrats! You have deployed and called your first Bitcoin smart contract.
